Planning and checking family budget
========================================================
transition: fade

To know if you will be begging for food or hiding from creditors,
check you in-flow of money and comprare it with your out-flow.

If the latter is more consistent than the other,
get ready for the end of the month.

In-money
========================================================
transition: zoom

- Main income (salary or pension)
- Profits from investments

Out-money
========================================================
transition: concave

- Rent or mortage
- Bills such as electricity, water, rubbish collection...
- House maintainance
- Home/Car/Life/Health insurance
- Car fuel
- Car maintainance
- School for children
- Recreative activities (cinema, concerts, sports)
- Food
- Tax (it is not optional in several countries)
- Something to take apart as savings for rainy days


Examples
========================================================
transition: linear


```r
salary<-2000;
rent<-800;
recreative<-5000;
other<-600;
salary-(rent+recreative+other)
```

```
[1] -4400
```

that is bad. Try reducing your fun activities and you'll be ok:

```r
recreative<-50;
salary-(rent+recreative+other)
```

```
[1] 550
```
